Hi, my name is Edward and as a freelance data analyst, I translate data into valuable and comprehensible insights. My goal is to improve results, make the right data driven decisions and save costs. Since I was young, I have always enjoyed to solve puzzles. So thatâ€™s how I look at big data sets: to me it is one big puzzle I want to solve. Finding patterns nobody else sees is the challenge to me. I have a passion for learning with a growth mindset and this is a valuable asset as data is continously being collected and I stongly believe that the solutions to complex business questions lies in the ability to analyze data and letting the data speak to you. As a member on a team, here is a summary of some of the qualities I would add to the team;
- Passionate result driven Data Analyst who can; extract, transform, load (ETL) data from multiple sources using Alteryx, perform statistical analysis of data and query databases using MySQL, and perform data visualization reporting using Tableau and Power BI. 
- Key team player seeking a challenging and rewarding career in a diverse environment where my strong work ethic, detail oriented, problem solving, critical and analytical thinking mind for math and numbers can be used to help promote the team mission and exceed team goals. 
- Determined individual with drive to expand my career with a growth mindset and a passion for learning new skills and willingness to constantly reinvent and learn new technologies and approaches.
