As a freelance data analyst, I translate data into valuable and comprehensible insights. I have a passion for analyzing data and helping others/organization make the right data driven decisions which can help improve results, and save costs. Since I was young, I have always enjoyed solving puzzles and thatâ€™s how I look at big data sets, to me it is one big puzzle I want to solve and finding patterns nobody else sees is the challenge to me. I have a passion for learning with a growth mindset and this is a valuable asset as data is continuosly evolving along with the tools used to analyze data so as an analyst, this type of mindset enables me to easily reinvent myself and be open to learning the new and/or updated tools. I stongly believe that the solutions to complex business questions lies in the ability to analyze data and letting the data speak to you. As a member on a team, here is a summary of some of the qualities I would add to the team;
- Passionate result driven Data Analyst who can; extract, transform, load (ETL) data from multiple sources using Alteryx, perform statistical analysis of data and query databases using MySQL, and perform data visualization reporting using Tableau and Power BI.
- Strong work ethic, detail oriented, problem solving, critical and analytical thinking with a mind for math and numbers can be used to help promote the team mission and exceed team goals as a key team player.
- Determined individual with drive to expand my career with a growth mindset and a passion for learning new skills and willingness to constantly reinvent and learn new technologies and approaches.
