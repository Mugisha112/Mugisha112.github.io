Hi, my name is Edward and as a freelance data analyst, I translate data into valuable and comprehensible insights. My goal is to improve results, make the right data driven decisions and save costs. Since I was young, I have always enjoyed to solve puzzles. So thatâ€™s how I look at big data sets: to me it is one big puzzle I want to solve. Finding patterns nobody else sees is the challenge to me. I have a passion for learning with a growth mindset and this is a valuable asset as data is continously being collected and I stongly believe that the solutions to complex business questions lies in the ability to analyze data and letting the data speak to you.
